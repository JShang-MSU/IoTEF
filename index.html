					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>Internet-of-Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that is playing an important role in the development of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). IoT focuses on expanding the ability of connecting numerous devices, enhancing sensing capabilities, and providing local data processing capabilities. Considering many vulnerabilities have been presented against IoT technologies and devices, many technologies and applications emerge to develop to ensure secure, privacy-preserving, efficient, and sustainable CPSs. This workshop provides a platform to the researchers to publish their innovative ideas, extensive analysis of their comparative studies, critical review of existing research and position papers in the above areas. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>IoT devices and protocols security</li>
							<li>Attack detection and prevention in IoT</li>
							<li>Privacy-preserving techniques in IoT</li>
							<li>Secure integration of IoT and cloud /Edge computing</li>
							<li>Machine learning techniques for IoT security</li>
							<li>Secure network architecture for IoT</li>
							<li>Secure data management approaches</li>
							<li>Security in cyber-physical systems</li>
							<li>Authentication and access control</li>
							<li>Blockchain technologies for reliable and trustworthy IoTs</li>
							<li>Cybersecurity prevention and response strategies</li>
							<li>Emergent cybersecurity risks arising from IoT-enabled 5G</li>
							<li>Situation awareness of IoT environment</li>
							<li>Governance, policy, and compliance</li>
							<li>Awareness and training approaches</li>
							<li>Security architecture and frameworks</li>
							<li>Threat and vulnerability analysis</li>
						</ul>
